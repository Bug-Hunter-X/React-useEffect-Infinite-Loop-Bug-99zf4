This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the `useEffect` hook.  The initial code causes an infinite loop because a state variable used inside the `useEffect` is not included in its dependency array. The solution shows how to correctly add the necessary dependency to prevent the infinite loop. This is a crucial concept for understanding how React's state updates interact with effects.
